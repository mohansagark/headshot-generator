## Performance Notes

- First startup: 5-10 minutes (downloading models)
- Subsequent runs: 30-60 seconds
- Memory usage: ~2-4GB (recommend paid tier for better performance)

## üîß Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Common Deployment Problems

#### 1. "Unable to locate package" Error
**Problem**: System packages not found in `packages.txt`
**Solution**: 
- Ensure `packages.txt` contains system dependencies:
  ```
  libgl1-mesa-glx
  libglib2.0-0
  libsm6
  libxext6
  ```

#### 2. Memory/Resource Errors
**Problem**: AI models too large for free tier
**Solutions**:
- Use `requirements-minimal.txt` instead of `requirements-deploy.txt`
- Upgrade to paid tier for more memory
- Try alternative platforms (Railway, Render)

#### 3. Import/Dependency Errors
**Problem**: Package version conflicts
**Solutions**:
- Check specific error in deployment logs
- Try `requirements-minimal.txt` for basic functionality
- Restart deployment after code changes

### Alternative Requirements Files

#### Standard Deployment (2GB RAM)
File: `requirements-deploy.txt`
- ‚úÖ AI headshot generation
- ‚úÖ Background removal
- ‚úÖ Image enhancement
- ‚ùå Advanced face detection

#### Minimal Deployment (500MB RAM)
File: `requirements-minimal.txt`
- ‚ùå AI generation (too resource intensive)
- ‚úÖ Background removal
- ‚úÖ Basic image processing
- ‚úÖ File upload/download

#### Full Local Development (4GB+ RAM)
File: `requirements.txt`
- ‚úÖ All features
- ‚úÖ Face detection
- ‚úÖ Advanced AI models
- ‚úÖ Batch processing

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### Streamlit Cloud
1. In advanced settings, try different requirements files:
   - First: `requirements-deploy.txt`
   - If failed: `requirements-minimal.txt`
2. Python version: `3.11`
3. Check logs for specific errors

#### Heroku
1. Add `Procfile`:
   ```
   web: streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0
   ```
2. Use `requirements-deploy.txt`
3. Enable hobby dyno for more memory

#### Railway
1. Auto-detects Python app
2. Set start command: `streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT`
3. Use `requirements-deploy.txt`

### Deployment Status Indicators

When successfully deployed, you should see:
- üåê "Running on [Platform]" message
- ‚úÖ "Headshot generator initialized successfully!"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional compatibility warnings (normal for cloud deployment)
